Antiviral therapies are the most widely used application, designed to suppress viral replication and reduce the viral load in patients. These therapies often include nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as tenofovir and entecavir, which are highly effective in managing chronic hepatitis B infection. By reducing the viral load, these antiviral drugs help in mitigating liver damage and improving long-term patient outcomes. The efficacy of these drugs has made them a cornerstone of hepatitis B management globally.</p><p>Immune modulators represent another crucial segment of the hepatitis B therapeutics market. These agents work by enhancing the body's immune response against the hepatitis B virus, aiming to achieve a sustained virologic response and potentially lead to a functional cure. Examples of immune modulators include interferon-alpha, which stimulates the immune system to target and destroy infected liver cells. In addition, combination therapies, which involve using both antiviral agents and immune modulators, are increasingly being explored to enhance treatment efficacy and address the challenge of drug resistance. This multi-faceted approach aims to provide more comprehensive management of hepatitis B, catering to diverse patient needs and improving overall treatment outcomes.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=820008&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=280</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Hepatitis B Therapeutics Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>GlaxoSmithKline</Li><Li> Bristol-Myers Squibb</Li><Li> Novira Therapeutics</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> Abivax</Li><Li> F.
